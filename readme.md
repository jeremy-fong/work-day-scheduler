## Portfolio
The main goal of the project is to create a workday scheduler.

## Description 
This is a workday scheduler that displays typical work times from 7AM-5PM. The user is able to enter in tasks or other information and save it to the schedule, so that once refreshed the saved information persists. There is also a clear button which will clear all the events in the schedule.
